// To continue on with the pokemon theme, we've found a
// pokemon API for you to practice on --> https://pokeapi.co/.
// If you go to this page --> https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/,
// you can see all of the endpoints available.
// We will start with the endpoint named pokemon.

// The goal is to change the content of our mystery table in
// HTML to contain info about one specific pokemon. To get you
// started, we've created some variables for you to use later on:

const image = document.getElementById("image");
console.log(image);
const name = document.getElementById("name");
const element = document.getElementById("element");
const weight = document.getElementById("weight");
const height = document.getElementById("height");
const types = document.getElementById("types");

// 1) Start with updating the fetchPokemons function so that
//    it's fetching the pokemons from the pokemon endpoint and
//    logs the results in the console.
//    HINT --> Don't forget to invoke the function

//create variable to improve URL usage along code
const URL = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon';
//create variable to store the json in an array
let pokemonData = [];

fetch(URL)
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((json) => {
    console.log(json.results);//2.a remove metadata by adding .results
    pokemonData = json.results;
    console.log("exercise 2.b: ", pokemonData.at(0)); //2.b
    
    pokemonData.forEach((pokemon) => {//2.c
      console.log("exercise 2.c: ", pokemon.name);
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('caught error', err);
    
  });

// 2) a) As you can see, we get some metadata as well as
//    the results of the fetch. Change the console.log so
//    that you only log the array of pokemon objects.



//    b) Log only the name of the first pokemon in the
//    pokemon objects array



//    c) Log the names of all pokemons in the array

// 3) You might know that there are more than 20 pokemons
//    in the pokedex (1050 to be exact). Add a query parameter
//    called "limit" to the URL, and set it to a number of your
//    choice, like this: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151
//    and pick a pokemon that you would like to continue
//    working with. Copy the pokemon's URL.

// 4) Now that we've picked a pokemon, we will do a new fetch
//    to the URL we copied. Since that's another endpoint,
//    we will create a new fetch inside the fetchBulbasaurData
//    function (change the function's name to fit your pokemon).
//    Log the data in the console and see what you find.

const fetchCharizardData = async () => {
  
};

// 5) After familiarizing with the data, we will use the data
//    to change our table. We will give you the image as a start.
//    If you named the data something else than json, you change the
//    word json below so it corresponds with your code. Here goes:
//    image.src = json.sprites.front_default;
//    Copy that line into the fetchBulbasaurData and hopefully
//    the image in the HTML updates.

// 6) Update the innerHTML of the other rows as well after
//    you've found the correct path in the json.
//    HINT --> Log stuff in the console to try things out
//    HINT --> If it's an array - map over the array

// ***BONUS***
// Check out the API's documentation and try to fetch from another
// endpoint! There are many - as you can see in the first link
